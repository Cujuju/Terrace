reed-cone — Terrace building delivery

Original: 2048 x 2048 textures. Low: 1024 x 1024 textures, in low subfolder.
Each variant: editable packed reed-cone.blend; reed-cone.glb with embedded PNGs;
reed-cone-ktx2.glb with embedded UASTC KTX2s; separate basecolor, normal and
metallicRoughness PNG and KTX2 maps. Exactly one mesh, primitive and material.
Hierarchy: RootNode > reed-cone. Identity object transforms; geometry in world units.
No Draco or meshopt. No production integration or LOD switching implemented.

Provenance
Improved original first-party Terrace procedural model from plugins/structures/client/fishingHuts.ts (original procedural base); not third-party geometry. New UVs and all texture maps authored in Blender pipeline.
Textures are original procedural paint, not generated concept pixels or old maps.
Concept: reed-cone-concept.png, built-in image generator. Exact prompt: concept-prompt.txt.
Exact backend image-model version cannot be selected or verified; no version claim.
Shared authoring and validation code derives from the completed in-repo longhouse.
The immutable source-inventory.json records first-party procedural base geometry.
The third-party cottage supplies bounds only, never mesh or texture data.

Historical plausibility (editorial judgment, not an authenticity certification)
3/5 — Preindustrial coastal vernacular; undated. Reed roof, daub and fish processing are plausible; no specific culture or archaeological site is claimed.
Rubric: 1 fantasy, 2 hybrid/anachronistic, 3 plausible type with substantial stylization,
4 coherent period cues, 5 documented reconstruction. None claims reconstruction.
Broad eras are independent of Terrace tier progression; cultures are not ranked.

Placement and LOD alignment
glTF Y up; entrance +Z.
Origin: Original placement origin retained; ground contact corrected to zero.
Original glTF dimensions X/Y/Z: [0.6245052218437195, 0.75, 0.7067241668701172]
Bounds: {'min': [-0.31225261092185974, 0.0, -0.31172415614128113], 'max': [0.31225261092185974, 0.75, 0.39500001072883606]}
Deliberate differences: Original silhouette and horizontal extents preserved. Broad edges chamfered in original; low uses coplanar simplification. Sub-ground source slivers corrected to Y=0.
Maximum original/low bounds difference: 0.000000000 world units.
Low preserves the important silhouette; excludes broad-edge chamfers and reduces
roof segments, curved profiles or small sign detail where applicable.

Measured geometry, UVs and memory
original: 1,368 triangles, 2,789 exported vertices; 624 UV islands; minimum island bounds gap 12.000 px; density 1005.113-1005.161 px/world unit.
  GPU mesh 0.135 MiB; PNG total 64.135 MiB; KTX2 BC7/ASTC total 16.136 MiB.
low: 728 triangles, 1,518 exported vertices; 392 UV islands; minimum island bounds gap 12.001 px; density 459.957-459.962 px/world unit.
  GPU mesh 0.074 MiB; PNG total 16.074 MiB; KTX2 BC7/ASTC total 4.074 MiB.
UVs wholly inside 0-1; exported triangles tested for positive-area intersections.
No overlapping islands, collapsed UV triangles or zero-area mesh triangles.
Atlases independently packed at each delivered resolution with a 12 px target gap.
Per-face planar projection at uniform density; no stacked/mirrored UV islands.

Texture and runtime verification
Base colour sRGB. Tangent-space normal uses OpenGL/glTF +Y green, XYZ retained.
Normal height derivatives account for UV vertical direction; unit normals encoded RGB.
MetallicRoughness is linear RGB: R=1 unused, G=roughness, B=0 metalness.
All six KTX2 textures: UASTC, complete mip chains (12 levels original, 11 low),
base sRGB, normal/MR linear, no channel swizzle. KTX-Software glTF-basisu validation passed.
KHR_texture_basisu is required and each texture references an embedded KTX2 image.
Every geometry accessor bufferView matches the PNG GLB byte-for-byte after packing.
Embedded texture bytes match delivered standalone files. Decoded UASTC metalness
is zero through every mip (mip-channel-verification.json); compression-verification.json
records channel error and normal angular error at the base level.
Validation uses UASTC-to-RGBA8 decoding, not all possible hardware transcodes.

Memory assumptions
PNG: RGBA8 GPU storage plus complete mip chains (64 MiB textures original, 16 low).
KTX2: BC7 or ASTC 4x4 at 16 bytes/block with all mips (16 MiB original, 4 low).
Actual GPU format depends on device support; uncompressed fallback may cost PNG-level memory.
Calculated totals include exported vertex/index bytes, not live GPU measurements.
Exclude driver allocation, CPU loader/image copies, shaders, scene objects and framebuffers.
Repeated instances share mesh and textures. Loading both variants adds both totals:
PNG 80.209 MiB;
KTX2 20.209 MiB.

Screenshots
reed-cone-45deg.png and reed-cone-closeup.png render the exported PNG GLB in Blender.
The low subfolder uses identical cameras and lighting; comparison.png pairs them.
These show finished meshes, not concepts, and are studio renders, not game screenshots.
Artifacts was unavailable; local image delivery is the requested fallback.
